# Coordinate_Drawer

The main file gets some different types of input from the file named file1.txt.
Line 2 gives us the matrix width and height respectively.
Line 3 gives us how many agents will be shown.
After the number_of_agents input, we will get agent coordinates as many as the counter.
After all the agent coordinates are given we will be given number_of_blocks info.
Following block_counter information just as the agents, we will get block coordinates.
The code solves some spacing problems in the text file.
It also checks whether a coordinate has a block, if so even though there exists an agent
or any other they will not be printed.
Also for a coordinate, if there isn't any block there but many agents, "0" will be printed.
